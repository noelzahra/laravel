    <h2>About the Laravel framework</h2>
    <p>The Laravel framework has a few system requirements.
        Of course, all of these requirements are satisfied by the 
        Laravel Homestead virtual machine, so it's highly 
        recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel 
        development environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to 
        make sure your server meets the following requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>PHP >= 7.0.0</li>
        <li>OpenSSL PHP Extension</li>
        <li>PDO PHP Extension</li>
        <li>Mbstring PHP Extension</li>
        <li>Tokenizer PHP Extension</li>
        <li>XML PHP Extension</li>
    </ul>
